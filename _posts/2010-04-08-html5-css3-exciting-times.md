After rebuilding my site in HTML5 and using CSS3 I have decided to do a small series of what can be done. HTML5 is very exciting and powerful and CSS3 finally adds some features that designers have wanted for years but developers have cried over (drop shadows for example, or curved boxes).

So the first in the series is this post, and it will be the shortest post. The Doctype. Now, every time I start a site, I can never remember the full Doctype, especially for XHTML 1.0 which is quite lengthy. I do find the following as a quick lookup very useful though: http://perishablepress.com/press/2006/08/30/xhtml-document-header-resource/.

HTML5 is different, the doctype is:
{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
{% endhighlight %}

Lovely! It is that simple, love it!
