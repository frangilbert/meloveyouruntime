Amazon web services are really amazing. A growing line of products which are really useful for the developer to use for storage or queues, a simple database, up to full hosting solutions.

I've been shying away from the services a little for commercial sites as I imagined having to write a library to call their REST services. I did have a look online for a decent C# library, but didn't turn up anything that up to date, and the Amazon documentation example of a C# call looked flimsy. So today, as I was about to make do with [ThreeSharp](http://www.codeplex.com/ThreeSharp), a decent looking open source library, I realised they have no stopped support in favour of Amazon's own new library.

Despite my looking on the site, this completely passed me by. I'm trying it out now with the S3 service for a site we need to implement this for.
