Recently I tried to log into my SQL server install. Getting the password wrong a few times it blocked me out. The problem is, most of the web explains how to reset the password if you are already logged into SQL server. If you do get blocked, you can run SQL Server Management Studio in administrator mode and log in with the correct password without being blocked, then change it from the console once in.
